<!-- Roadmap -->
## :compass: Roadmap
Here, are some known bugs and WIP, all the items here should be resolved in a few days. 

* [ ] Don't add to queue items that are already in queue or have been scanned - That causes loops.
* [ ] Usage of Priority Queue instead of a simple Queue.
* [ ] Bring back `--depth` arg
